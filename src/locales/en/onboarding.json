Those token holders can earn a share of the revenue you generate, get early access to your videos, and all sorts of cool things that you control."

This is done by the use of tokens. By holding tokens, you become a partial owner of the organization, the same way that a stock gives you partial ownership of a company.<br/>The difference is that you can use your ownership to influence the decisions of the organization. For example, you can apply to becoming a council member, or vote in the council member election. You can upload a proposal to suggest a new idea, and it will be voted on by the council. You can use your ownership to get your say in the direction of the organization, and not in a theoretical way, but in actual on-chain voting that cannot be defrauded. Also, everything is transparent, and out in the open for anyone to see, including budget & salaries."

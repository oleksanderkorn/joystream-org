By holding tokens, you become a partial owner of the organization, the same way that a stock gives you partial ownership of a company.<br/>The difference is that you can use your ownership to influence the decisions of the organization. For example, you can apply to becoming a council member, or vote in the council member election. You can upload a proposal to suggest a new idea, and it will be voted on by the council. You can use your ownership to get your say in the direction of the organization, and not in a theoretical way, but in actual on-chain voting that cannot be defrauded.
